# PRODIGY_CS_Task-3
🔒 Third Internship Task at Prodigitech! 🛡️

Exciting news from my journey as a Cyber Security Intern at Prodigitech! This time, I delved into enhancing password security with a custom-built strength checker using Python. Here’s an overview of what I’ve developed:

🔐 Password Strength Checker:

I've created a Python function that evaluates password strength based on various criteria:
🛡️ Features:

Criteria Evaluation: Evaluates passwords based on length, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
Feedback: Provides clear feedback on password strength — whether it's Weak, Good, or Strong.
Detailed Insights: Offers a breakdown of which criteria the password meets.
Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to explore cybersecurity challenges at Prodigitech!
